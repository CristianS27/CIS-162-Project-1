    <p>My name is Cristian Salinas, but you may call me Cris. I have loved working with computers since I was a kid. I have a little bit of coding knowledge thanks to my experience with web design. I mostly use the templets that let you plug in what you want. I would like to be able to understand the coding aspect of it to further my knowledge.</p>
